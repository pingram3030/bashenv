# Bash Libraries

## alias.sh

These are aliases I use across all hosts

## common.sh

These functions are handy to have in ones arsenal.

## complete.sh

Bash tab completion is the duck's nuts, bee's knees and dogs bollocks.

These functions create completion functions for each app.

## cred.sh

WIP

## environment.sh

This creates handy 'environment' functions to make switching between and using
an environment easy. An environment can contain multiple repositories and need
special functions etc.; this is a key part of the magic.

## host.sh

Between hosts there are aliases, env vars and functions that are only relevant
to that host.

## private.sh

Some functions, aliases, etc. I do not want to be version controlled. Those
private libraries reside in the $PWD/private dir.

## state.sh

As time marches on git repos may be added or removed, so I need to track state
of things; this is primarily used by `complete.sh`.

## vim.sh

Vim r0x0rz, and there are some defaults I like to have across my systems.
