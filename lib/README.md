# Bash Libraries

## alias.sh
These are aliases I use across all hosts

## app.sh
This could possibly be better named, but I am calling an 'app' the application
of this bash system to a $thing.

I.e. I do work for CompanyX, the app is "CompanyX"

## common.sh
These functions are handy to have in ones arsenal.

## complete.sh
Bash tab completion is the duck's nuts, bee's knees and dogs bollocks.

These functions create completion functions for each app.

## cred.sh
WIP

## host.sh
Between hosts there are aliases, env vars and functions that are only relevant
to that host.

## private.sh
Some functions, aliases, etc. I do not want to be version controlled. Those
private libraries reside in the $PWD/private dir.

## state.sh
As time marches on git repos may be added or removed, so I need to track state
of things; this is primarily used by `complete.sh`.

## vim.sh
Vim r0x0rz, and there are some defaults I like to have across my systems.
